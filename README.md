# This is a bash script written for an assignment in my Master's course.
# A script that allows the user to search for specific lines in a log according to a pattern they provide and have these lines written to a new file for further use.
# Prompts the user for:
# 1)  The pattern to be searched for
# 2)  Whether they want an whole word match or any match on the line
# 3)  If they want to do an inverted match, i.e. retrieve lines that do not contain the pattern
# If no match is found, report to the user “No matches found”.
# If a match is found, echo the number of matches found, e.g. 5 matches found, and then each of matching word(s)/line(s) to the terminal with their corresponding line numbers in the source file.
# The user has the option to do another search if he so wishes or exit the script.
# All search options are case-insensitive.
# Code will not be updated.
